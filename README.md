# 🌾 Farm Assist - Smart Farming, Powered by AI

**Empowering India's farmers with AI-driven insights for better crop decisions and financial security.**

## 🚜 Project Overview

Farm Assist is a comprehensive agricultural platform designed to bridge the digital divide for India's farming community. With over 80% of India's agricultural workforce consisting of small and marginal farmers, this platform addresses critical challenges that contribute to crop losses, poor market returns, and long-term financial insecurity.

## 🌟 The Problem We Solve

Small and marginal farmers across India face significant barriers that prevent them from maximizing their agricultural potential:

These challenges result in substantial crop losses, reduced income, and perpetual financial instability for farming families.
